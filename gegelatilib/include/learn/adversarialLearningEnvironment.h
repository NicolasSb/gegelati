     * The main difference with the base Learning Environment is that several
     * roots will participate in a single simulation.
     * It is the user responsibility to correctly adapt this class to the
     * problem. In fact, there should be 2 overrides that will be different from
     * the basic Learning Environment :
     * - doAction will be called by the Learning Agent with participating roots
     * in turn. If there are 3 roots in this simulation, the first will call
     * doAction, then the second one, and the third one. Then, it will be the
     * first root again. Note that each root will use the same dataSource.
     * It means the user has to update the dataSource so that each root will
     * see the input from its point of view (doing that, a root that was first
     * to act will not be lost of it becomes third).
     * - getScores will be called by the Learning Agent once, at the end of the
     * game. It shall return an evaluation result containing the scores of the
     * roots, in the order in which they participated.
