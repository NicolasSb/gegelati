		* \brief This function randomly modifies the behavior of a
		* Program::Line.
		*
		* Probability of altering the different attributes of the Line is
		* computed as if the given Program::Line was encoded with a word of
		* Program::Program::computeLineSize() bits, and a single bit must be
		* flipped. This means that if the instructions represents n bits over
		* m, then there is a probability of n/m that the instruction of the
		* line is altered.
		* To avoid non-executable line, the alteration of instruction,
		* destination, or operands dataSource index are based on a uniform
		* probability within acceptable values.
		* If the selected Instruction is no longer compatible with types
		* provided by the line operands, or vice versa, then the function
		* will set things right by selecting new valid operands randomly.
		* Although this is biased toward operands volatility, this is the
		* a controlled complexity, and yet random, way to ensure that a valid
		* line is obtained. The alternative (from TPG reference PhD) would be
		* to repeatedly alter the line until a valid one is obtained.
		*
		* \param[in,out] line the Program::Line whose attributes are being
		* altered.
		* \param[in] rng Random Number Generator used in the mutation process.
